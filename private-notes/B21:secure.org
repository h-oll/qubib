** Overview
*** Claims (SMPC only)
- constant round,
- composable protocol
- maliciously secure
- for pseudo-deterministic functions[HO::i.e. fBQP]

The protocol is 6 rounds in the common random string model and can tolerate any kind of collusion
The protocol is 3 rounds in the PKI+QROM model
*** Asumption
- QLWE (quantum hardness of LWE)
- Specific assumptions relative to each model (PKI+QROM and CRS).

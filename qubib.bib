@Comment HOW TO ADD NEW ENTRIES

@Comment GENERATE YOUR KEY

@Comment The idea is to follow the following rule so that keys are permanent

@Comment 1. First letters of authors, capitalized, in the order of appearance

@Comment    No more than 4 authors

@Comment 2. Year of publication

@Comment 3. First word of the title, skip "On", "The", "A", lowercase

@Comment 4. Possibly deduplicate adding "b", etc (no "a" as one new entry would modify an old one) or -I, -II if a series of articles

@Comment DO NOT SORT THE NEW ENTRIES ADD THEM AT THE VERY END OF THE FILE

	abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	abstract = {In 2009, Abdalla et al. proposed a reasonably practical password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) secure against adaptive adversaries in the universal composability (UC) framework. It exploited the Canetti-Fischlin methodology for commitments and the Cramer-Shoup smooth projective hash functions (SPHFs), following the Gennaro-Lindell approach for PAKE. In this paper, we revisit the notion of non-interactive commitments, with a new formalism that implies UC security. In addition, we provide a quite efficient instantiation. We then extend our formalism to SPHF-friendly commitments. We thereafter show that it allows a blackbox application to one-round PAKE and oblivious transfer (OT), still secure in the UC framework against adaptive adversaries, assuming reliable erasures and a single global common reference string, even for multiple sessions. Our instantiations are more efficient than the Abdalla et al.  PAKE in Crypto 2009 and the recent OT protocol proposed by Choi et al. in PKC 2013. Furthermore, the new PAKE instantiation is the first one-round scheme achieving UC security against adaptive adversaries.},

	abstract = {Entanglement is a quantum resource, in some ways analogous to randomness in classical computation. Inspired by recent work of Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define the notion of "pseudoentanglement'', a property exhibited by ensembles of efficiently constructible quantum states which are indistinguishable from quantum states with maximal entanglement. Our construction relies on the notion of quantum pseudorandom states -- first defined by Ji, Liu and Song -- which are efficiently constructible states indistinguishable from (maximally entangled) Haar-random states. Specifically, we give a construction of pseudoentangled states with entanglement entropy arbitrarily close to $\log n$ across every cut, a tight bound providing an exponential separation between computational vs information theoretic quantum pseudorandomness. We discuss applications of this result to Matrix Product State testing, entanglement distillation, and the complexity of the AdS/CFT correspondence. As compared with a previous version of this manuscript (arXiv:2211.00747v1) this version introduces a new pseudorandom state construction, has a simpler proof of correctness, and achieves a technically stronger result of low entanglement across all cuts simultaneously.},

The protocol is fundamentally different from the original sum-check protocol of [LFKN92, Sha92], as well as from variants of this proof [GKR08, Mei09], though it still possesses the overall structure of inductively checking consistency between subsequent step. The protocol is inspired by [AAV13]. Hopefully, this protocol will be helpful in making progress towards two major open problems: resolving the quantum PCP question, and verification of quantum computations using a classical BPP verifier. Given the historical importance of the sum-check protocol in classical computational complexity, we hope that the new protocol will also find applications in classical complexity theory.},

Our proof also applies to concatenation of higher-distance codes, and to noise models that allow faults to be correlated in space and in time. The proof uses new criteria for assessing the accuracy of fault-tolerant circuits, which are particularly conducive to the inductive analysis of recursive simulations. Our lower bound on the threshold, epsilon_0 > 2.73 \times 10^{-5} for an adversarial independent stochastic noise model, is derived from a computer-assisted combinatorial analysis; it is the best lower bound that has been rigorously proven so far.},

	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2019,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02840v2},
	abstract = {In this paper we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of PAC learning. In order to attain our results, we establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure cryptosystems. We then achieve the following results.  1) Hardness of learning AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ under the uniform distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$), the class of constant-depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial-time (resp. strong sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial-time quantum learning algorithm for TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$) under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random functions that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution.  2) Hardness of learning TC$^0_2$ in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class TC$^0_2$, i.e., depth-2 TC$^0$ circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists of decryption functions of the cryptosystem.  This gives a strong (conditional) negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson [Aar05], who asked if AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.},

We explore how to extend this to multiple parties, using threshold fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE). In such scheme, the parties jointly generate a common FHE public key along with a secret key that is shared among them; they can later cooperatively decrypt ciphertexts without learning anything but the plaintext. We show how to instantiate this approach efficiently, by extending the recent FHE schemes of Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO '11, FOCS '11, ITCS '12) based on the (ring) learning with errors assumption. Our main tool is to exploit the property that such schemes are additively homomorphic over their keys.",

	abstract = {Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation (HQC) are two very different computational methods. The computation in MBQC is driven by adaptive measurements executed in a particular order on a large entangled state. In contrast in HQC the system starts in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian which is slowly changed such that a transformation occurs within the subspace. Following the approach of Bacon and Flammia, we show that any measurement-based quantum computation on a graph state with \emph{gflow} can be converted into an adiabatically driven holonomic computation, which we call \emph{adiabatic graph-state quantum computation} (AGQC). We then investigate how properties of AGQC relate to the properties of MBQC, such as computational depth. We identify a trade-off that can be made between the number of adiabatic steps in AGQC and the norm of $\dot{H}$ as well as the degree of $H$, in analogy to the trade-off between the number of measurements and classical post-processing seen in MBQC. Finally the effects of performing AGQC with orderings that differ from standard MBQC are investigated.},

Say Alice wants Bob to compute some known function f upon her input x, but wants to prevent Bob from learning anything about x. The situation arises for instance if client Alice has limited computational resources in comparison with mistrusted server Bob, or if x is an inherently mobile piece of data.  Could there be a protocol whereby Bob is forced to compute f(x) "blindly", i.e.  without observing x? We provide such a blind computation protocol for the class of functions which admit an efficient procedure to generate random input-output pairs, e.g. factorization. The cheat-sensitive security achieved relies only upon quantum theory being true. The security analysis carried out assumes the eavesdropper performs individual attacks.

	abstract = {This PhD thesis combines two of the most exciting research areas of the last decades: quantum computing and machine learning. We introduce dissipative quantum neural networks (DQNNs), which are designed for fully quantum learning tasks, are capable of universal quantum computation and have low memory requirements while training. These networks are optimised with training data pairs in form of input and desired output states and therefore can be used for characterising unknown or untrusted quantum devices. We not only demonstrate the generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations, but also implement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the ultimate limits for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the quantum no free lunch theorem, which describes a bound on the probability that a quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is optimised with quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover we expand the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first case, we include additional information beyond just the training data pairs: since quantum devices are always structured, the resulting data is always structured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge about the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the training process and show that this can lead to better generalisation behaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including graph structure are trained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation.  However, in the second extension of the algorithm we aim to learn characteristics of a set of quantum states in order to extend it to quantum states which have similar properties. Therefore we build a generative adversarial model where two DQNNs, called the generator and discriminator, are trained in a competitive way.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07152v1},
	abstract = {Sampling problems demonstrating beyond classical computing power with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices have been experimentally realized. In those realizations, however, our trust that the quantum devices faithfully solve the claimed sampling problems is usually limited to simulations of smaller-scale instances and is, therefore, indirect. The problem of verifiable quantum advantage aims to resolve this critical issue and provides us with greater confidence in a claimed advantage. Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling has been proposed to achieve beyond classical capabilities with a verifiable scheme based on quadratic-residue codes (QRC).  Unfortunately, this verification scheme was recently broken by an attack proposed by Kahanamoku-Meyer. In this work, we revive IQP-based verifiable quantum advantage by making two major contributions. Firstly, we introduce a family of IQP sampling protocols called the \emph{stabilizer scheme}, which builds on results linking IQP circuits, the stabilizer formalism, coding theory, and an efficient characterization of IQP circuit correlation functions.  This construction extends the scope of existing IQP-based schemes while maintaining their simplicity and verifiability. Secondly, we introduce the \emph{Hidden Structured Code} (HSC) problem as a well-defined mathematical challenge that underlies the stabilizer scheme. To assess classical security, we explore a class of attacks based on secret extraction, including the Kahanamoku-Meyer's attack as a special case. We provide evidence of the security of the stabilizer scheme, assuming the hardness of the HSC problem. We also point out that the vulnerability observed in the original QRC scheme is primarily attributed to inappropriate parameter choices, which can be naturally rectified with proper parameter settings.},

In this model we propose solutions to two tasks - a protocol for efficient classical verification that the untrusted device is "truly quantum," and a protocol for producing certifiable randomness from a single untrusted quantum device. Our solution relies on the existence of a new cryptographic primitive for constraining the power of an untrusted quantum device: post-quantum secure trapdoor claw-free functions which must satisfy an adaptive hardcore bit property. We show how to construct this primitive based on the hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem.},

Specifically, we show how to extract from such a decomposition a matching entangled graph state (with inputs), and a set of measurements angles, when there is one. Next, we check whether the obtained graph state verifies a "flow" condition, which guarantees an execution order such that the dependent measurements and corrections of the pattern yield deterministic results. Using a graph theoretic characterization of flows, we can determine whether a flow can be constructed for a graph state in polynomial time. This approach yields an algorithmic procedure which, when it succeeds, may produce an efficient pattern for a given unitary.},

	abstract = {State transformation problems such as compressing quantum information or breaking quantum commitments are fundamental quantum tasks. However, their computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs.  To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and zero knowledge protocols.  The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions, implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity of many natural quantum information processing tasks.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speed-ups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up fundamental questions, among them the issue of whether quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computation. We show, in theory and experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced here uses the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is required only to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer.

A threshold functionality enables a secret key to be split into a number of shares, so that only a threshold of parties can use the key, without reconstructing the key. We begin by constructing a threshold fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (ThFHE) from the learning with errors (LWE) problem. We next introduce a new concept, called a universal thresholdizer, from which many threshold systems are possible. We show how to construct a universal thresholdizer from our ThFHE. A universal thresholdizer can be used to add threshold functionality to many systems, such as CCA-secure public-key encryption (PKE), signature schemes, pseudorandom functions, and others primitives. In particular, by applying this paradigm to a (non-threshold) lattice signature system, we obtain the first single-round threshold signature scheme from LWE.",

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01293v2},
	abstract = {A test of quantumness is a protocol that allows a classical verifier to certify (only) that a prover is not classical. We show that tests of quantumness that follow a certain template, which captures recent proposals such as (Kalai et al., 2022), can in fact do much more. Namely, the same protocols can be used for certifying a qubit, a building-block that stands at the heart of applications such as certifiable randomness and classical delegation of quantum computation.  Certifying qubits was previously only known to be possible based on the hardness of the Learning with Errors problem and the use of adaptive hardcore (Brakerski et al., 2018). Our framework allows certification of qubits based only on the existence of post-quantum trapdoor claw-free functions, or on quantum fully homomorphic encryption. These can be instantiated, for example, from Ring Learning with Errors.  On the technical side, we show that the quantum soundness of any such protocol can be reduced to proving a bound on a simple algorithmic task: informally, answering ``two challenges simultaneously'' in the protocol. Our reduction formalizes the intuition that these protocols demonstrate quantumness by leveraging the impossibility of rewinding a general quantum prover. This allows us to prove tight bounds on the quantum soundness of (Kahanamoku-Meyer et al., 2021) and (Kalai et al., 2022), showing that no quantum polynomial-time prover can succeed with probability larger than $\cos^2 \frac{\pi}{8}\approx 0.853$. Previously, only an upper bound on the success probability of classical provers, and a lower bound on the success probability of quantum provers, were known. We then extend this proof of quantum soundness to show that provers that approach the quantum soundness bound must perform almost anti-commuting measurements. This certifies that the prover holds a qubit.},

	abstract = {One-time programs are modelled after a black box that allows a single evaluation of a function, and then self-destructs. Because software can, in principle, be copied, general one-time programs exists only in the hardware token model: it has been shown that any function admits a one-time program as long as we assume access to physical devices called one-time memories. Quantum information, with its well-known property of no-cloning, would, at first glance, prevent the basic copying attack for classical programs. We show that this intuition is false: one-time programs for both classical and quantum maps, based solely on quantum information, do not exist, even with computational assumptions. We complement this strong impossibility proof by an equally strong possibility result: assuming the same basic one-time memories as used for classical one-time programs, we show that every quantum map has a quantum one-time program that is secure in the universal composability framework. Our construction relies on a new, simpler quantum authentication scheme and corresponding mechanism for computing on authenticated data.},

LDPCC previously discussed in the literature have involved matrices constructed using random techniques. In this paper, we discuss construction techniques for LDPCC involving multiple permutation matrices, each specified by a linear congruence. Construction options depend on the size of the parity-check matrix and the rate of the code. We relate desirable properties of the code to the parameters defining the linear congruences specifying the permutation matrices used to construct the code. For example, codes with few or no 4-cycles can be readily constructed. We summarize the construction options and describe selection processes for the parameters of the congruences. We then provide performance results for regular parity-check matrices constructed by random and the linear-congruence techniques for rate 1/2 transmit block-size 980 and rate 4/7 transmit block-size 847 codes. We introduce a symmetric channel model for decoding with the iterative belief propagation algorithm and describe its use as a heuristic for deciding whether a code is likely better or worse than most codes of the given rate and block size.",

	url = {http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8766v2},
	abstract = {Fully homomorphic encryption is an encryption method with the property that any computation on the plaintext can be performed by a party having access to the ciphertext only. Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum homomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such that quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our schemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for circuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion of the circuit (we use the "$\pi/8$" non-Clifford group gate, which is also known as the $T$-gate).  More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a decryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of $T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with the total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of length given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate depth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant $T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption scheme.  A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of encryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In this context, we show the equivalence of several definitions.  Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern cryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical results establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number of multiplication gates. Historically, such results appeared as precursors to the breakthrough result establishing classical fully homomorphic encryption.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers, besides offering substantial computational speedups, are also expected to preserve the privacy of a computation. We present an experimental demonstration of blind quantum computing in which the input, computation, and output all remain unknown to the computer. We exploit the conceptual framework of measurement-based quantum computation that enables a client to delegate a computation to a quantum server. Various blind delegated computations, including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch and Grover quantum algorithms, are demonstrated. The client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is crucial for unconditionally secure quantum cloud computing and might become a key ingredient for real-life applications, especially when considering the challenges of making powerful quantum computers widely available.},

	abstract = {Translations between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based one-way model are useful for verification and optimisation of quantum computations. They make crucial use of a property known as gflow. While gflow is defined for one-way computations allowing measurements in three different planes of the Bloch sphere, most research so far has focused on computations containing only measurements in the XY-plane. Here, we give the first circuit-extraction algorithm to work for one-way computations containing measurements in all three planes and having gflow. The algorithm is efficient and the resulting circuits do not contain ancillae. One-way computations are represented using the ZX-calculus, hence the algorithm also represents the most general known procedure for extracting circuits from ZX-diagrams. In developing this algorithm, we generalise several concepts and results previously known for computations containing only XY-plane measurements. We bring together several known rewrite rules for measurement patterns and formalise them in a unified notation using the ZX-calculus. These rules are used to simplify measurement patterns by reducing the number of qubits while preserving both the semantics and the existence of gflow. The results can be applied to circuit optimisation by translating circuits to patterns and back again.},

	abstract = {Given that reliable cloud quantum computers are becoming closer to reality, the concept of delegation of quantum computations and its verifiability is of central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single measurement.  We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. This also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This provides the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof system for QMA.  As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for n EPR pairs using only constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification. Along the way, we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stability result due to Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common argument used in self-testing.},

	abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;In this paper we analyze for the first time the post-quantum security of AES. AES is the most popular and widely used block cipher, established as the encryption standard by the NIST in 2001. We consider the secret key setting and, in particular, AES-256, the recommended primitive and one of the few existing ones that aims at providing a post-quantum security of 128 bits. In order to determine the new security margin, i.e., the lowest number of non-attacked rounds in time less than 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions, we first provide generalized and quantized versions of the best known cryptanalysis on reduced-round AES, as well as a discussion on attacks that don’t seem to benefit from a significant quantum speed-up. &lt;br&gt;We propose a new framework for structured search that encompasses both the classical and quantum attacks we present, and allows to efficiently compute their complexity. We believe this framework will be useful for future analysis.&lt;br&gt;Our best attack is a quantum Demirci-Selçuk meet-in-the-middle attack. Unexpectedly, using the ideas underlying its design principle also enables us to obtain new, counter-intuitive classical TMD trade-offs. In particular, we can reduce the memory in some attacks against AES-256 and AES-128.&lt;br&gt;One of the building blocks of our attacks is solving efficiently the AES S-Box differential equation, with respect to the quantum cost of a reversible S-Box. We believe that this generic quantum tool will be useful for future quantum differential attacks. Judging by the results obtained so far, AES seems a resistant primitive in the post-quantum world as well as in the classical one, with a bigger security margin with respect to quantum generic attacks.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

	abstract = {The onset of the era of fully-programmable error-corrected quantum computers will be marked by major breakthroughs in all areas of science and engineering.  These devices promise to have significant technological and societal impact, notable examples being the analysis of big data through better machine learning algorithms and the design of new materials. Nevertheless, the capacity of quantum computers to faithfully implement quantum algorithms relies crucially on their ability to prepare specific high-dimensional and high-purity quantum states, together with suitable quantum measurements. Thus, the unambiguous certification of these requirements without assumptions on the inner workings of the quantum computer is critical to the development of trusted quantum processors. One of the most important approaches for benchmarking quantum devices is through the mechanism of self-testing that requires a pair of entangled non-communicating quantum devices. Nevertheless, although computation typically happens in a localized fashion, no local self-testing scheme is known to benchmark high dimensional states and measurements. Here, we show that the quantum self-testing paradigm can be employed to an individual quantum computer that is modelled as a programmable black box by introducing a noise-tolerant certification scheme. We substantiate the applicability of our scheme by providing a family of outcome statistics whose observation certifies that the computer is producing specific high-dimensional quantum states and implementing specific measurements.},

	abstract = {Nonlocal games play a crucial role in quantum information theory and have numerous applications in certification and cryptographic protocols. Kalai et al. (STOC 2023) introduced a procedure to compile a nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive proof, using a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, and showed that their compilation method preserves the classical bound of the game. Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS 2023) then showed that the quantum bound is preserved for the specific case of the CHSH game. Extending the proof techniques of Natarajan and Zhang, we show that the compilation procedure of Kalai et al. preserves the quantum bound for two classes of games: XOR games and d-outcome CHSH games. We also establish that, for any pair of qubit measurements, there exists an XOR game such that its optimal winning probability serves as a self-test for that particular pair of measurements.},

Similarly, for encryption, we allow the adversary to issue quantum chosen ciphertext queries: given a superposition of ciphertexts, the adversary receives a superposition of their decryptions.

Bob can do universal quantum computation and claims he is willing to help, but Alice wants to be sure that Bob cannot learn her input, the result of her calculation, or perhaps even the function she is trying to compute. We describe a simple, efficient protocol by which Bob can help Alice perform the computation, but there is no way for him to learn anything about it. We also discuss techniques for Alice to detect whether Bob is honestly helping her or if he is introducing errors.},

Ollivier 2023-09-15 - Idea is to start from symmetry verification, which projects the final state onto the correct subspace -- i.e. makes the measurement and discards anything that doesn't fall into the right subspace.  - Perform the projection through random application of the group generating the symmetry (this is done through uniform sampling) - Now we are not forced to take a uniform sampling, this is symmetry expansion - They introduce a metric for the performance of this class of schemes and identify two contributions. One is always positive, the other can be negative (and compensate the positiviy of the other). => try to balance both.  - Section 6.3 describes how noise is decomposable into detectable / undetectable components and makes partial analytic computation.  --> },

	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2020,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07925v2},
	abstract = {Secure two-party computation considers the problem of two parties computing a joint function of their private inputs without revealing anything beyond the output. In this work, we consider the setting where the two parties (a classical Alice and a quantum Bob) can communicate only via a classical channel. Our first result shows that it is in general impossible to realize a two-party quantum functionality with black-box simulation in the case of malicious quantum adversaries. In particular, we show that the existence of a secure quantum computing protocol that relies only on classical channels would contradict the quantum no-cloning argument.  We circumvent this impossibility following three different approaches. The first is by considering a weaker security notion called one-sided simulation security. This notion protects the input of one party (the quantum Bob) in the standard simulation-based sense and protects the privacy of the other party's input (the classical Alice). We show how to realize a protocol that satisfies this notion relying on the learning with errors assumption. The second way to circumvent the impossibility result, while at the same time providing standard simulation-based security also against a malicious Bob, is by assuming that the quantum input has an efficient classical representation.  Finally, we focus our attention on the class of zero-knowledge functionalities and provide a compiler that takes as input a classical proof of quantum knowledge (PoQK) protocol for a QMA relation R and outputs a zero-knowledge PoQK for R that can be verified by classical parties. The direct implication of our result is that Mahadev's protocol for classical verification of quantum computations (FOCS'18) can be turned into a zero-knowledge proof of quantum knowledge with classical verifiers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to instantiate such a primitive.},

How can parties handle confidential data if they do not trust everyone involved? This text is the first to present a comprehensive treatment of unconditionally secure techniques for multiparty computation (MPC) and secret sharing. In a secure MPC, each party possesses some private data, while secret sharing provides a way for one party to spread information on a secret such that all parties together hold full information, yet no single party has all the information. The authors present basic feasibility results from the last 30 years, generalizations to arbitrary access structures using linear secret sharing, some recent techniques for efficiency improvements, and a general treatment of the theory of secret sharing, focusing on asymptotic results with interesting applications related to MPC.},

A crucial property for hash functions in the post-quantum setting is the collapsing property (a strengthening of collision-resistance). We show that the sponge construction is collapsing (and in consequence quantum collision-resistant) under suitable assumptions about the underlying block function. In particular, if the block function is a random function or a (non-invertible) random permutation, the sponge construction is collapsing. We also give a quantum algorithm for finding collisions in an arbitrary function. For the sponge construction, the algorithm complexity asymptotically matches the complexity implied by collision resistance.},

In our second orthogonal contribution, we improve the costly Remote State Preparation protocols [CCKW18,CCKW19,GV19] that can classically fake a quantum channel (this is at the heart of our NIZKoQS protocol) by showing how to create a multi-qubits state from a single superposition.  Finally, we generalize these results to a multi-party setting and prove that multiple parties can anonymously distribute a GHZ state in such a way that only participants knowing a secret credential can share this state, which could have applications to quantum anonymous transmission, quantum secret sharing, quantum onion routing and more.},

	abstract = {(Sender-)Deniable encryption provides a very strong privacy guarantee: a sender who is coerced by an attacker into "opening" their ciphertext after-the-fact is able to generate "fake" local random choices that are consistent with any plaintext of their choice. The only known fully-efficient constructions of public-key deniable encryption rely on indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) (which currently can only be based on sub-exponential hardness assumptions). In this work, we study (sender-)deniable encryption in a setting where the encryption procedure is a quantum algorithm, but the ciphertext is classical. First, we propose a quantum analog of the classical definition in this setting. We give a fully efficient construction satisfying this definition, assuming the quantum hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. Second, we show that quantum computation unlocks a fundamentally stronger form of deniable encryption, which we call perfect unexplainability.  The primitive at the heart of unexplainability is a quantum computation for which there is provably no efficient way, such as exhibiting the "history of the computation", to establish that the output was indeed the result of the computation. We give a construction which is secure in the random oracle model, assuming the quantum hardness of LWE. Crucially, this notion implies a form of protection against coercion "before-the-fact", a property that is impossible to achieve classically.},

	abstract = {Finding ground states of quantum many-body systems is known to be hard for both classical and quantum computers. As a result, when Nature cools a quantum system in a low-temperature thermal bath, the ground state cannot always be found efficiently. Instead, Nature finds a local minimum of the energy. In this work, we study the problem of finding local minima in quantum systems under thermal perturbations. While local minima are much easier to find than ground states, we show that finding a local minimum is computationally hard for classical computers, even when the task is to output a single-qubit observable at any local minimum. In contrast, we prove that a quantum computer can always find a local minimum efficiently using a thermal gradient descent algorithm that mimics the cooling process in Nature. To establish the classical hardness of finding local minima, we consider a family of two-dimensional Hamiltonians such that any problem solvable by polynomial-time quantum algorithms can be reduced to finding ground states of these Hamiltonians. We prove that for such Hamiltonians, all local minima are global minima. Therefore, assuming quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation, finding local minima is classically hard and quantumly easy.},

	abstract = {In order to bring quantum networks into the real world, we would like to determine the requirements of quantum network protocols including the underlying quantum hardware. Because detailed architecture proposals are generally too complex for mathematical analysis, it is natural to employ numerical simulation. Here we introduce NetSquid, the NETwork Simulator for QUantum Information using Discrete events, a discrete-event based platform for simulating all aspects of quantum networks and modular quantum computing systems, ranging from the physical layer and its control plane up to the application level. We study several use cases to showcase NetSquid’s power, including detailed physical layer simulations of repeater chains based on nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond as well as atomic ensembles. We also study the control plane of a quantum switch beyond its analytically known regime, and showcase NetSquid’s ability to investigate large networks by simulating entanglement distribution over a chain of up to one thousand nodes.},

Our main technical contribution is a tool for studying the action of consecutive measurements on a quantum state which in turn gives upper bounds on the value of some entangled games. This allows us to prove the security of our protocol against quantum adversaries. We also prove security bounds for the (single-round) relativistic string commitment and bit commitment in parallel against quantum adversaries. As an additional consequence of our result, we answer an open question from [Unr12] and show tight bounds on the quantum knowledge error of some {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varSigma {\$}{\$}-protocols.",

	abstract = {The foundation of zero-knowledge is the simulator: a weak machine capable of pretending to be a weak verifier talking with all-powerful provers. To achieve this, simulators need some kind of advantage such as the knowledge of a trapdoor. In existing zero-knowledge multi-prover protocols, this advantage is essentially signalling, something that the provers are explicitly forbidden to do. In most cases, this advantage is stronger than necessary as it is possible to define a sense in which simulators need much less to simulate. We define a framework in which we can quantify the simulators' non-local advantage and exhibit examples of zero-knowledge protocols that are sound against local or entangled provers but that are not sound against no-signalling provers precisely because the no-signalling simulation strategy can be adopted by malicious provers.},

Our relation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can control the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its ``information content''. Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in the analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very powerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks.",

	abstract = "Attacks on cryptographic protocols are usually modeled by allowing an adversary to ask queries to an oracle. Security is then defined by requiring that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint, there is some problem the adversary cannot solve, such as compute a certain piece of information. Even if the protocol is quantum, the queries are typically classical. In this paper, we introduce a new model of quantum attacks on protocols, where the adversary is allowed quantum access to the primitive, i.e., he may ask several classical queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly stronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several primitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure with threshold {\$}{\$}t{\$}{\$}tin the standard model is secure against superposition attacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to {\$}{\$}t/2{\$}{\$}t/2. This holds for all classical as well as all known quantum secret sharing schemes. We then consider zero- knowledge and first show that known protocols are not, in general, secure in our model by designing a superposition attack on the well-known zero-knowledge protocol for graph isomorphism. We then use our secret-sharing result to design zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP in the common reference string model. While our protocol is classical, it is sound against a cheating unbounded quantum prover and computational zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed a superposition attack. Finally, we consider multiparty computation and give a characterization of a class of protocols that can be shown secure, though not necessarily with efficient simulation. We show that this class contains non-trivial protocols that cannot be shown secure by running a classical simulator in superposition.",

Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness -- the computation is hidden from the server -- and those that are also verifiable -- the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct ``trace/distance/type'' criteria -- which are, individually, non/composable security definitions.",

Even in the extreme case where a computation is performed between k mutually distrustful players, and security is required even for the single honest player if all other players are colluding adversaries, secure protocols are known. For quantum computation, on the other hand, protocols allowing arbitrary dishonest majority have only been proven for {\$}{\$}k=2{\$}{\$}. In this work, we generalize the approach taken by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail (CRYPTO 2012) in the two-party setting to devise a secure, efficient protocol for multi-party quantum computation for any number of players k, and prove security against up to {\$}{\$}k-1{\$}{\$}colluding adversaries. The quantum round complexity of the protocol for computing a quantum circuit of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}CNOT{\}}, {\backslash}mathsf {\{}T{\}} {\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}depth d is {\$}{\$}O(k {\backslash}cdot (d + {\backslash}log n)){\$}{\$}, where n is the security parameter. To achieve efficiency, we develop a novel public verification protocol for the Clifford authentication code, and a testing protocol for magic-state inputs, both using classical multi-party computation.",

	abstract = {The question of whether a fully classical client can delegate a quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server while fully maintaining privacy (blindness) is one of the big open questions in quantum cryptography. Both yes and no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the question seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely delegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client modest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In this work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of the minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum computation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind quantum computing protocols, the "quantum" part of the protocol, from the clients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum correlations (independent from the computation) between the client and the server, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only classical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase, specifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the client, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a universally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each step reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to prepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare just two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are arbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind quantum computation.},

The proof uses a recent result of Watrous [20] that allows quantum rewinding for protocols of a certain form. We then discuss two applications. First, the combination of coin-flipping with any non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol leads to an easy transformation from non-interactive zero-knowledge to interactive quantum zero-knowledge. Second, we discuss how our protocol can be applied to a recently proposed method for improving the security of quantum protocols [4], resulting in an implementation without set-up assumptions. Finally, we sketch how to achieve efficient simulation for an extended construction in the common-reference-string model.",

	abstract = {Schemes of classical shadows have been developed to facilitate the read-out of digital quantum devices, but similar tools for analog quantum simulators are scarce and experimentally impractical. In this work, we provide a measurement scheme for fermionic quantum devices that estimates second and fourth order correlation functions by means of free fermionic, translationally invariant evolutions - or quenches - and measurements in the mode occupation number basis. We precisely characterize what correlation functions can be recovered and equip the estimates with rigorous bounds on sample complexities, a particularly important feature in light of the difficulty of getting good statistics in reasonable experimental platforms, with measurements being slow.  Finally, we demonstrate how our procedure can be approximately implemented with just nearest-neighbour, translationally invariant hopping quenches, a very plausible procedure under current experimental requirements, and requiring only random time-evolution with respect to a single native Hamiltonian. On a conceptual level, this work brings the idea of classical shadows to the realm of large scale analog quantum simulators.},

	abstract = {We introduce a simulator of a quantum internet with the specific goal to support software development. A quantum internet consists of local quantum processors, which are interconnected by quantum communication channels that enable the transmission of qubits between the different processors. While many simulators exist for local quantum processors, there is presently no simulator for a quantum internet tailored towards software development. Quantum internet protocols require both classical as well as quantum information to be exchanged between the network nodes, next to the execution of gates and measurements on a local quantum processor. This requires quantum internet software to integrate classical communication programming practises with novel quantum ones. SimulaQron is built to enable application development and explore software engineering practises for a quantum internet. SimulaQron can be run on one or more classical computers to simulate local quantum processors, which are transparently connected in the background to enable the transmission of qubits or the generation of entanglement between remote processors. Application software can access the simulated local quantum processors to execute local quantum instructions and measurements, but also to transmit qubits to remote nodes in the network. SimulaQron features a modular design that performs a distributed simulation based on any existing simulation of a quantum computer capable of integrating with Python. Programming libraries for Python and C are provided to facilitate application development.}

	abstract = {With recent progress on experimental quantum information processing, an important question has arisen as to whether it is possible to verify arbitrary computation performed on a quantum processor. A number of protocols have been proposed to achieve this goal, however all are interactive in nature, requiring that the computation be performed in an interactive manner with back and forth communication between the verifier and one or more provers. Here we propose two methods for verifying quantum computation in a non-interactive manner based on recent progress in the understanding of the local Hamiltonian problem. Provided that the provers compute certain witnesses for the computation, this allows the result of a quantum computation to be verified after the fact, a property not seen in current verification protocols.},

We prove that, given any learning problem (under reasonable assumptions), an algorithm designed for i.i.d. input states can be adapted to handle input states of any nature, albeit at the expense of a polynomial increase in copy complexity. Furthermore, we establish that algorithms which perform non-adaptive incoherent measurements can be extended to encompass non-i.i.d.  input states while maintaining comparable error probabilities. This allows us, among others applications, to generalize the classical shadows of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill to the non-i.i.d. setting at the cost of a small loss in efficiency. Additionally, we can efficiently verify any pure state using Clifford measurements, in a way that is independent of the ideal state. Our main techniques are based on de Finetti-style theorems supported by tools from information theory. In particular, we prove a new randomized local de Finetti theorem that can be of independent interest.},

The definition is expressed in terms of simple quantum- information-theoretic conditions which must be satisfied by the protocol to be secure. The conditions are uniquely determined by the ideal functionality {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$} defining the cryptographic task to be implemented. We then show the following composition result. If quantum protocols $\pi$ 1,...,$\pi$ ℓ securely implement ideal functionalities {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$} according to our security definition, then any purely classical two-party protocol, which makes sequential calls to {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$} , is equally secure as the protocol obtained by replacing the calls to {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$} with the respective quantum protocols $\pi$ 1,...,$\pi$ ℓ. Hence, our approach yields the minimal security requirements which are strong enough for the typical use of quantum protocols as subroutines within larger classical schemes. Finally, we show that recently proposed quantum protocols for secure identification and oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model satisfy our security definition, and thus compose in the above sense.",

	title = {Estimating the Entropy of Shallow Circuit Outputs Is Hard},
	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2020,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12814},
	abstract = {The decision problem version of estimating the Shannon entropy is the Entropy Difference problem (ED): given descriptions of two circuits, determine which circuit produces more entropy in its output when acting on a uniformly random input. The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED) is to determine which circuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on a fixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be intractable for polynomial-time quantum computation. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these problems in the case where the input circuits have logarithmic and constant depth, respectively. We show that, relative to an oracle, these problems cannot be as hard as their counterparts with polynomial-size circuits. Furthermore, we show that if a certain type of reduction from QED to the log-depth version exists, it implies that any polynomial-time quantum computation can be performed in log depth. While this suggests that having shallow circuits makes entropy estimation easier, we give indication that the problem remains intractable for polynomial-time quantum computation by proving a reduction from Learning-With-Errors (LWE) to constant-depth ED. We then consider a potential application of our results to quantum gravity research. First, we introduce a Hamiltonian version of QED where one is given two local Hamiltonians and asked to estimate the entanglement entropy difference in their ground states. We show that this problem is at least as hard as the circuit version and then discuss a potential experiment that would make use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to solve LWE efficiently. We conjecture that unless the AdS/CFT bulk to boundary map is exponentially complex, this experiment would violate the intractability assumption of LWE.},

	journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
	abstract = {With experimental quantum computing technologies now in their infancy, the search for efficient means of testing the correctness of these quantum computations is becoming more pressing. An approach to the verification of quantum computation within the framework of interactive proofs has been fruitful for addressing this problem. Specifically, an untrusted agent (prover) alleging to perform quantum computations can have his claims verified by another agent (verifier) who only has access to classical computation and a small quantum device for preparing or measuring single qubits. However, when this quantum device is prone to errors, verification becomes challenging and often existing protocols address this by adding extra assumptions, such as requiring the noise in the device to be uncorrelated with the noise on the prover’s devices. In this paper, we present a simple protocol for verifying quantum computations, in the presence of noisy devices, with no extra assumptions. This protocol is based on post hoc techniques for verification, which allow for the prover to know the desired quantum computation and its input. We also perform a simulation of the protocol, for a one-qubit computation, and find the error thresholds when using the qubit repetition code as well as the Steane code.}

They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first completely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even stronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be achievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption circuits.",

	abstract = {With quantum devices rapidly approaching qualities and scales needed for fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work, we have assessed the performance of IBM superconducting quantum computer devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with increasing circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code threshold calculations. Circuit operator change rate statistics in the presence of depolarizing and biased noise were modelled using analytic functions of error model parameters. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles was found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, favouring instead biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations investigated via $Z$ stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal correlation in detection events. These results highlight the non-trivial structure which may be present in the noise of quantum error correction circuits, revealed by operator measurement statistics, and support the development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt.},

More precisely, every language in BQL has an (information-theoretically secure) streaming proof with a quantum logspace prover and a classical logspace verifier. The prover provides a polynomial-length proof that is streamed to the verifier. The verifier has a read-once one-way access to that proof and is able to verify that the computation was performed correctly. That is, if the input is in the language and the prover is honest, the verifier accepts with high probability, and, if the input is not in the language, the verifier rejects with high probability even if the prover is adversarial. Moreover, the verifier uses only $O(\log n)$ random bits.},

	abstract = {Constructor theory is a meta-theoretic approach that seeks to characterise concrete theories of physics in terms of the (im)possibility to implement certain abstract “tasks” by means of physical processes.  Process theory, on the other hand, pursues analogous characterisation goals in terms of the compo- sitional structure of said processes, concretely presented through the lens of (symmetric monoidal) category theory. In this work, we show how to formulate fundamental notions of constructor the- ory within the canvas of process theory. Specifically, we exploit the functorial interplay between the symmetric monoidal structure of the category of sets and relations, where the abstract tasks live, and that of symmetric monoidal categories from physics, where concrete processes can be found to implement said tasks. Through this, we answer the question of how constructor theory relates to the broader body of process-theoretic literature, and provide the impetus for future collaborative work between the fields},

	abstract = {Randomness is an intrinsic feature of quantum theory. The outcome of any quantum measurement will be random, sampled from a probability distribution that is defined by the measured quantum state. The task of sampling from a prescribed probability distribution is therefore a natural technological application of quantum devices. In the research presented in this thesis, I investigate the complexity-theoretic and physical foundations of quantum sampling algorithms. I assess the computational power of natural quantum simulators and close loopholes in the complexity-theoretic argument for the classical intractability of quantum samplers (Part I). I shed light on how and under which conditions quantum sampling devices can be tested or verified in regimes that are not simulable on classical computers (Part II). Finally, I explore the computational boundary between classical and quantum computing devices (Part III). In particular, I develop efficiently computable measures of the infamous Monte Carlo sign problem and assess those measures both in terms of their practicability as a tool for alleviating or easing the sign problem and the computational complexity of this task.  An overarching theme of the thesis is the quantum sign problem which arises due to destructive interference between paths -- an intrinsically quantum effect. The (non-)existence of a sign problem takes on the role as a criterion which delineates the boundary between classical and quantum computing devices.  I begin the thesis by identifying the quantum sign problem as a root of the computational intractability of quantum output probabilities. It turns out that the intricate structure of the probability distributions the sign problem gives rise to, prohibits their verification from few samples. In an ironic twist, I show that assessing the intrinsic sign problem of a quantum system is again an intractable problem.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

This test has lead to several cryptographic applications. In particular, it has been applied to producing certifiable randomness from a single untrusted quantum device, self-testing a single quantum device and device-independent quantum key distribution.  In this paper, we show that this test of quantumness, and essentially all the above applications, can actually be implemented by a very weak class of quantum circuits: constant-depth quantum circuits combined with logarithmic-depth classical computation. This reveals novel complexity-theoretic properties of this fundamental test of quantumness and gives new concrete evidence of the superiority of small-depth quantum circuits over classical computation.},

	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2021,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05393v1},
	abstract = {Broadbent and Islam (TCC '20) proposed a quantum cryptographic primitive called quantum encryption with certified deletion. In this primitive, a receiver in possession of a quantum ciphertext can generate a classical certificate that the encrypted message is deleted. Although their construction is information-theoretically secure, it is limited to the setting of one-time symmetric key encryption (SKE), where a sender and receiver have to share a common key in advance and the key can be used only once. Moreover, the sender has to generate a quantum state and send it to the receiver over a quantum channel in their construction. Although deletion certificates are privately verifiable, which means a verification key for a certificate has to be kept secret, in the definition by Broadbent and Islam, we can also consider public verifiability.  In this work, we present various constructions of encryption with certified deletion.  - Quantum communication case: We achieve (reusable-key) public key encryption (PKE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) with certified deletion. Our PKE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of IND-CPA secure PKE, and our ABE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way function. These two schemes are privately verifiable.  - Classical communication case: We also achieve PKE with certified deletion that uses only classical communication. We give two schemes, a privately verifiable one and a publicly verifiable one. The former is constructed assuming the LWE assumption in the quantum random oracle model. The latter is constructed assuming the existence of one-shot signatures and extractable witness encryption.},

	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2024,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16679v1},
	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative entanglement-based protocol to address the Dining Cryptographers Problem, utilizing maximally entangled $\ket{ GHZ_{ n } }$ tuples as its core. This protocol aims to provide scalability in terms of both the number of cryptographers $n$ and the amount of anonymous information conveyed, represented by the number of qubits $m$ within each quantum register.  The protocol supports an arbitrary number of cryptographers $n$, enabling scalability in both participant count and the volume of anonymous information transmitted. While the original Dining Cryptographers Problem focused on a single bit of information, i.e., whether a cryptographer paid for dinner, the proposed protocol allows $m$, the number of qubits in each register, to be any arbitrarily large positive integer. This flexibility permits the conveyance of various information, such as the cost of the dinner or the timing of the arrangement. Another noteworthy aspect of the introduced protocol is its versatility in accommodating both localized and distributed versions of the Dining Cryptographers problem. The localized scenario involves all cryptographers gathering physically at the same location, such as a restaurant, simultaneously. In contrast, the distributed scenario accommodates cryptographers situated in different places, engaging in a virtual dinner at the same time. Finally, in terms of implementation, the protocol ensures uniformity by requiring all cryptographers to utilize identical private quantum circuits. This design establishes a completely modular quantum system where all modules are identical. Furthermore, each private quantum circuit exclusively employs the widely used Hadamard and CNOT quantum gates, facilitating straightforward implementation on contemporary quantum computers.},

	abstract = {We propose and analyze a novel interactive protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage, which is efficiently classically verifiable. Our protocol relies upon the cryptographic hardness of trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs). Through a surprising connection to Bell's inequality, our protocol avoids the need for an adaptive hardcore bit, with essentially no increase in the quantum circuit complexity and no extra cryptographic assumptions.  Crucially, this expands the set of compatible TCFs, and we propose two new constructions: one based upon the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem and the other based upon Rabin's function, $x^2 \bmod N$. We also describe two independent innovations which improve the efficiency of our protocol's implementation: (i) a scheme to discard so-called "garbage bits", thereby removing the need for reversibility in the quantum circuits, and (ii) a natural way of performing post-selection which significantly reduces the fidelity needed to demonstrate quantum advantage. These two constructions may also be of independent interest, as they may be applicable to other TCF-based quantum cryptography such as certifiable random number generation. Finally, we design several efficient circuits for $x^2 \bmod N$ and describe a blueprint for their implementation on a Rydberg-atom-based quantum computer.},

	abstract = {The k-local Hamiltonian problem is a natural complete problem for the complexity class QMA, the quantum analog of NP. It is similar in spirit to MAX-k-SAT, which is NP-complete for k<=2. It was known that the problem is QMA-complete for any k <= 3. On the other hand 1-local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

	abstract = {With the advent of delegated quantum computing as a service, verifying quantum computations is becoming a question of great importance. Existing information theoretically Secure Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) protocols require the client to possess the ability to perform either trusted state preparations or measurements. Whether it is possible to verify universal quantum computations with information-theoretic security without trusted preparations or measurements was an open question so far. In this paper, we settle this question in the affirmative by presenting a modular, composable, and efficient way to turn known verification schemes into protocols that rely only on trusted gates.  Our first contribution is an extremely lightweight reduction of the problem of quantum verification for BQP to the trusted application of single-qubit rotations around the Z axis and bit flips. The second construction presented in this work shows that it is generally possible to information-theoretically verify arbitrary quantum computations with quantum output without trusted preparations or measurements. However, this second protocol requires the verifier to perform multi-qubit gates on a register whose size is independent of the size of the delegated computation.},

	abstract = "Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past few years. However, due to limitations in the scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of blind quantum computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of computing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum computing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework. We prove the security of the protocol against a dishonest server and against dishonest clients, under the assumption of common classical cryptographic constructions.",

	abstract = {Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information theory and technologies, but its quantification has been a persistent challenge. Recently, Concentratable Entanglement (CE) has been introduced as a promising candidate for a multipartite entanglement measure, which can be efficiently estimated across two state copies. In this work, we introduce Generalized Concentratable Entanglement (GCE) measures, highlight a natural correspondence to quantum Tsallis entropies, and conjecture a new entropic inequality that may be of independent interest. We show how to efficiently measure the GCE in a quantum computer, using parallelized permutation tests across a prime number of state copies. We exemplify the practicality of such computation for probabilistic entanglement concentration into W states with three state copies. Moreover, we show that an increased number of state copies provides an improved error bound on this family of multipartite entanglement measures in the presence of imperfections. Finally, we prove that GCE is still a well-defined entanglement monotone as its value, on average, does not increase under local operations and classical communication (LOCC).},

	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2023,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08870v1},
	abstract = {The Unitary Synthesis Problem (Aaronson-Kuperberg 2007) asks whether any $n$-qubit unitary $U$ can be implemented by an efficient quantum algorithm $A$ augmented with an oracle that computes an arbitrary Boolean function $f$. In other words, can the task of implementing any unitary be efficiently reduced to the task of implementing any Boolean function?  In this work, we prove a one-query lower bound for unitary synthesis. We show that there exist unitaries $U$ such that no quantum polynomial-time oracle algorithm $A^f$ can implement $U$, even approximately, if it only makes one (quantum) query to $f$. Our approach also has implications for quantum cryptography: we prove (relative to a random oracle) the existence of quantum cryptographic primitives that remain secure against all one-query adversaries $A^{f}$. Since such one-query algorithms can decide any language, solve any classical search problem, and even prepare any quantum state, our result suggests that implementing random unitaries and breaking quantum cryptography may be harder than all of these tasks.  To prove this result, we formulate unitary synthesis as an efficient challenger-adversary game, which enables proving lower bounds by analyzing the maximum success probability of an adversary $A^f$. Our main technical insight is to identify a natural spectral relaxation of the one-query optimization problem, which we bound using tools from random matrix theory.  We view our framework as a potential avenue to rule out polynomial-query unitary synthesis, and we state conjectures in this direction.},

In this paper, we provide a complete description of Yao's protocol, along with a rigorous proof of security. Despite the importance of Yao's protocol to the theory of cryptography and in particular to the field of secure computation, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an explicit proof of security has been published.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic cooling (AC) protocols have been predominantly studied for their cooling capabilities, with limited attention paid to their thermodynamic properties. This work explores a novel perspective by analyzing a broad family of AC protocols from a thermodynamic standpoint. First, we give an in-depth review and formal classification of standard AC protocols. Leveraging the transfer matrix formalism, we achieve a consistent calculation of performance metrics, encompassing both cooling limits and target state evolution. We obtained a unification of these diverse cooling limits into a single, coherent mathematical expression, streamlining comparative analyses. Then, to assess the efficiency of coherent cooling protocols, we introduce two generic metrics: the coefficient of performance $K$ and the Landauer Ratio $R_L$, and establish a direct interrelation. Applying these metrics, we thoroughly evaluate selected AC protocols, highlighting their relative strengths. Finally, we propose improved versions of AC protocols that exhibit enhanced thermodynamic performance, achieving desired target temperatures with lower work inputs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of AC protocols and provides valuable insights for designing efficient cooling strategies in various applications.},

Unfortunately, existing proof techniques are incapable of proving the security of Fiat-Shamir in the quantum setting. The problem stems from (1) the difficulty of quantum rewinding, and (2) the inability of current techniques to adaptively program random oracles in the quantum setting. In this work, we show how to overcome the limitations above in many settings. In particular, we give mild conditions under which Fiat-Shamir is secure in the quantum setting. As an application, we show that existing lattice signatures based on Fiat-Shamir are secure without any modifications.",

Such a cryptographic scheme can be seen (and defined) as constructing a certain resource (e.g. a channel or key) with certain security properties from another (weaker) such resource. For example, a secure encryption scheme constructs a secure channel from an authenticated channel and a secret key.",

The scheme allows a classical client to blindly delegate a quantum computation to a quantum server: an honest server is able to run the computation while a malicious server is unable to learn any information about the computation. We show that it is possible to construct such a scheme directly from a quantum secure classical homomorphic encryption scheme with certain properties. Finally, we show that a classical homomorphic encryption scheme with the required properties can be constructed from the learning with errors problem.},

A large class of these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates.  In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance.  Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is the class of problems which, though potentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified efficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version of the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA, Merlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational resources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum resources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on single qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this grave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA for the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any quantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of this fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local Hamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to QMA$_1$, i.e., QMA with one-sided error.},

In particular, in quantum networks, it is essential for the parties involved to be able to verify if entanglement is present before they carry out a given distributed task. Here we design and experimentally demonstrate a protocol that allows any party in a network to check if a source is distributing a genuinely multipartite entangled state, even in the presence of untrusted parties. The protocol remains secure against dishonest behaviour of the source and other parties, including the use of system imperfections to their advantage. We demonstrate the verification protocol in a three- and four-party setting using polarization-entangled photons, highlighting its potential for realistic photonic quantum communication and networking applications.},

We use the leakage resilience properties of the Learning With Errors problem to address a key issue left open in previous work - the rate of generation of randomness. Our new protocol can certify $\Omega(n)$ fresh bits of randomness in constant rounds, where $n$ is a parameter of the protocol and the total communication is $O(n)$, thus achieving a nearly optimal rate. The proof that the output is statistically random is conceptually simple and technically elementary.},

For Wiesner's original scheme, it is determined that the optimal probability for a counterfeiter to create two copies of a bank note from one, where both copies pass the bank's test for validity, is (3/4)nfor n being the number of qubits used for each note. Generalizations in which other ensembles of states are substituted for the one considered by Wiesner are also discussed, including a scheme recently proposed by Pastawski, Yao, Jiang, Lukin, and Cirac, as well as schemes based on higher dimensional quantum systems. In addition, we introduce a variant of Wiesner's quantum money in which the verification protocol for bank notes involves only classical communication with the bank. We show that the optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can succeed in two independent verification attempts, given access to a single valid n-qubit bank note, is {\$}(3/4+{\backslash}sqrt{\{}2{\}}/8)^n{\$}. We also analyze extensions of this variant to higher-dimensional schemes.},

The field of QCs is growing: companies (such as DWave, IBM, Google, and Microsoft) are building QC offerings. We position that software engineers should look into defining a set of software engineering practices that apply to QC's software. To start this process, we give examples of challenges associated with testing such software and sketch potential solutions to some of these challenges.},

	journal = {CoRR},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04844v1},
	abstract = {Variational quantum circuits have recently gained much interest due to their relevance in real-world applications, such as combinatorial optimizations, quantum simulations, and modeling a probability distribution. Despite their huge potential, the practical usefulness of those circuits beyond tens of qubits is largely questioned. One of the major problems is the so-called barren plateaus phenomenon. Quantum circuits with a random structure often have a flat cost-function landscape and thus cannot be trained efficiently. In this paper, we propose two novel parameter conditions in which the hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) is free from barren plateaus for arbitrary circuit depths. In the first condition, the HEA approximates to a time-evolution operator generated by a local Hamiltonian. Utilizing a recent result by [Park and Killoran, Quantum 8, 1239 (2024)], we prove a constant lower bound of gradient magnitudes in any depth both for local and global observables. On the other hand, the HEA is within the many-body localized (MBL) phase in the second parameter condition.  We argue that the HEA in this phase has a large gradient component for a local observable using a phenomenological model for the MBL system. By initializing the parameters of the HEA using these conditions, we show that our findings offer better overall performance in solving many-body Hamiltonians. Our results indicate that barren plateaus are not an issue when initial parameters are smartly chosen, and other factors, such as local minima or the expressivity of the circuit, are more crucial.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of pricing discretely monitored Asian options over $T$ monitoring points where the underlying asset is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion. We provide two quantum algorithms with complexity poly-logarithmic in $T$ and polynomial in $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the additive approximation error. Our algorithms are obtained respectively by using an $O(\log T)$-qubit semi-digital quantum encoding of the Brownian motion that allows for exponentiation of the stochastic process and by analyzing classical Monte Carlo algorithms inspired by the semi-digital encodings. The best quantum algorithm obtained using this approach has complexity $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$ where the $\widetilde{O}$ suppresses factors poly-logarithmic in $T$ and $1/\epsilon$. The methods proposed in this work generalize to pricing options where the underlying asset price is modeled by a smooth function of a sub-Gaussian process and the payoff is dependent on the weighted time-average of the underlying asset price.},

	abstract = {We study the generalization properties of ridge regression with random features in the statistical learning framework. We show for the first time that $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ learning bounds can be achieved with only $O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ random features rather than $O({n})$ as suggested by previous results. Further, we prove faster learning rates and show that they might require more random features, unless they are sampled according to a possibly problem dependent distribution. Our results shed light on the statistical computational trade-offs in large scale kernelized learning, showing the potential effectiveness of random features in reducing the computational complexity while keeping optimal generalization properties.},

We first develop the error trade-off relations theoretically and then demonstrate the first experimental witness of joint measurements using a single ultracold 40Ca\&\#x002B; ion trapped in a harmonic potential. In addition, we report, that in contrast to the case of two observables, scarifying accuracy of any one of the three observables the rest of two can be measured with ultimate accuracy.}

	abstract = {The one-way model of Measurement-Based Quantum Computing and the gate-based circuit model give two different presentations of how quantum computation can be performed. There are known methods for converting any gate-based quantum circuit into a one-way computation, whereas the reverse is only efficient given some constraints on the structure of the measurement pattern. Causal flow and generalised flow have already been shown as sufficient, with efficient algorithms for identifying these properties and performing the circuit extraction. Pauli flow is a weaker set of conditions that extends generalised flow to use the knowledge that some vertices are measured in a Pauli basis. In this paper, we show that Pauli flow can similarly be identified efficiently and that any measurement pattern whose underlying graph admits a Pauli flow can be efficiently transformed into a gate-based circuit without using ancilla qubits.  We then use this relationship to derive simulation results for the effects of graph-theoretic rewrites in the ZX-calculus using a more circuit-like data structure we call the Pauli Dependency DAG.},

	abstract = {With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a supervised machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.},

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.},

	abstract = {Stabilizer states have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We present a simplified equivalent formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we also develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed theoretical formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states can find various promising applications including better design on variational quantum algorithms, qualitative understanding of phase transitions, and cornerstones for more advanced ground state ansatzes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13241v1},
	abstract = {Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising approach to reducing circuit depth in noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike gate-based computing, MBQC employs local measurements on a preprepared resource state, offering a trade-off between circuit depth and qubit count. Ensuring determinism is crucial to MBQC, particularly in the VQE context, as a lack of flow in measurement patterns leads to evaluating the cost function at irrelevant locations. This study introduces MBVQE-ans\"atze that respect determinism and resemble the widely used problem-agnostic hardware-efficient VQE ansatz. We evaluate our approach using ideal simulations on the Schwinger Hamiltonian and $XY$-model and perform experiments on IBM hardware with an adaptive measurement capability. In our use case, we find that ensuring determinism works better via postselection than by adaptive measurements at the expense of increased sampling cost. Additionally, we propose an efficient MBQC-inspired method to prepare the resource state, specifically the cluster state, on hardware with heavy-hex connectivity, requiring a single measurement round, and implement this scheme on quantum computers with $27$ and $127$ qubits. We observe notable improvements for larger cluster states, although direct gate-based implementation achieves higher fidelity for smaller instances.},

	abstract = {Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features (RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum advantage via PQC based optimization.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers can be used for supervised learning by treating parametrised quantum circuits as models that map data inputs to predictions.  While a lot of work has been done to investigate practical implications of this approach, many important theoretical properties of these models remain unknown.  Here we investigate how the strategy with which data is encoded into the model influences the expressive power of parametrised quantum circuits as function approximators. We show that one can naturally write a quantum model as a partial Fourier series in the data, where the accessible frequencies are determined by the nature of the data encoding gates in the circuit. By repeating simple data encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realise all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.},

We present a quantum version of the UC model which enjoys the same compositionality guarantees. We prove that in this model statistically secure oblivious transfer protocols can be constructed from commitments. Furthermore, we show that every statistically classically UC secure protocol is also statistically quantum UC secure. Such implications are not known for other quantum security definitions. As a corollary, we get that quantum UC secure protocols for general multi-party computation can be constructed from commitments.",

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15317v2},
	abstract = {Virtual distillation has been proposed as an error mitigation protocol for estimating the expectation values of observables in quantum algorithms. It proceeds by creating a cyclic permutation of $M$ noisy copies of a quantum state using a sequence of controlled-swap gates. If the noise does not shift the dominant eigenvector of the density operator away from the ideal state, then the error in expectation-value estimation can be exponentially reduced with $M$. In practice, subsequent error mitigation techniques are required to suppress the effect of noise in the cyclic permutation circuit itself, leading to increased experimental complexity. Here, we perform a careful analysis of the effect of uncorrelated, identical noise in the cyclic permutation circuit and find that the estimation of expectation value of observables are robust against dephasing noise. We support the analytical result with numerical simulations and find that $67\%$ of errors are reduced for $M=2$, with physical dephasing error probabilities as high as $10\%$. Our results imply that a broad class of quantum algorithms can be implemented with higher accuracy in the near-term with qubit platforms where non-dephasing errors are suppressed, such as superconducting bosonic qubits and Rydberg atoms.},

	abstract = {Quantum information and computation provide a fascinating twist on the notion of proofs in computational complexity theory. For instance, one may consider a quantum computational analogue of the complexity class \class{NP}, known as QMA, in which a quantum state plays the role of a proof (also called a certificate or witness), and is checked by a polynomial-time quantum computation. For some problems, the fact that a quantum proof state could be a superposition over exponentially many classical states appears to offer computational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof system setting, one may consider a verifier and one or more provers that exchange and process quantum information rather than classical information during an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum complexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum analogues of IP, SZK, and MIP. While quantum interactive proof systems inherit some properties from their classical counterparts, they also possess distinct and uniquely quantum features that lead to an interesting landscape of complexity classes based on variants of this model.  In this survey we provide an overview of many of the known results concerning quantum proofs, computational models based on this concept, and properties of the complexity classes they define. In particular, we discuss non-interactive proofs and the complexity class QMA, single-prover quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class QIP, statistical zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class \class{QSZK}, and multiprover interactive proof systems and the complexity classes QMIP, QMIP*, and MIP*.},

	abstract = {In the recent noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, the research on the combination of artificial intelligence and quantum computing has been greatly developed. Inspired by neural networks, developing quantum neural networks with specific structures is one of the most promising directions for improving network performance. In this work, we propose a quantum circuit-based algorithm to implement quantum residual neural networks (QResNets), where the residual connection channels are constructed by introducing auxiliary qubits to the data-encoding and trainable blocks of the quantum neural networks. Importantly, we prove that when this particular network architecture is applied to a $l$-layer data-encoding, the number of frequency generation forms can be extended from one, namely the difference of the sum of generator eigenvalues, to $\mathcal{O}(l^2)$. And the flexibility in adjusting the corresponding Fourier coefficients can also be improved due to the diversity of spectrum construction methods and the additional optimization degrees of freedom in the generalized residual operators. These results indicate that the residual encoding scheme can achieve better spectral richness and enhance the expressivity of various parameterized quantum circuits. Extensive numerical demonstrations in regression tasks of fitting various functions and applications in image classification with MNIST datasets are offered to present the expressivity enhancement. Our work lays the foundation for a complete quantum implementation of the classical residual neural networks and explores a new strategy for quantum feature map in quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {In recent years, quantum key distribution (QKD) has evolved from a scientific research field to a commercially viable security solution, supported by mathematically formulated security proofs. However, since the knowledge required for a full understanding of a security proof is scattered across numerous publications, it has proven difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of each step involved in the process and their limitations without considerable effort and attention to detail. Our paper aims to address this issue by presenting an accessible and comprehensive security proof for the finite-size 1-decoy (and 2-decoy) BB84 protocol in Renner's entropic uncertainty relation framework. We extensively consolidate and unify concepts from many works, thoroughly discussing the underlying assumptions and resolving technical inconsistencies. This work can serve as a foundation for the discussion of QKD security and for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and device imperfections. Our step-by-step approach and consistent notation assumes no prior exposure to security proofs, making it a robust and comprehensible reference, while maintaining theoretical rigor.  Therefore, our contribution represents a significant advancement towards a broader understanding of QKD security proofs.},

	ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in theoretical and experimental quantum computing raise the problem of verifying the outcome of these quantum computations. The recent verification protocols using blind quantum computing are fruitful for addressing this problem. Unfortunately, all known schemes have relatively high overhead. Here we present a novel construction for the resource state of verifiable blind quantum computation. This approach achieves a better verifiability of 0.866 in the case of classical output. In addition, the number of required qubits is 2N+4cN, where N and c are the number of vertices and the maximal degree in the original computation graph, respectively. In other words, our overhead is less linear in the size of the computational scale. Finally, we utilize the method of repetition and fault-tolerant code to optimise the verifiability.},

It is shown that any function computable in polynomial time by a quantum Turing machine has a polynomial-size quantum circuit. This result also enables us to construct a universal quantum computer which can simulate, with a polynomial factor slowdown, a broader class of quantum machines than that considered by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani (1993), thus answering an open question raised by them. We also develop a theory of quantum communication complexity, and use it as a tool to prove that the majority function does not have a linear-size quantum formula.<>},

	title = {A Quantum Approach for Reducing Communications in Classical Cryptographic Primitives},
	journal = {CoRR},
	year = 2023,
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05213v2},
	abstract = {How could quantum cryptography help us achieve what are not achievable in classical cryptography? In this work we consider the following problem, which we call succinct RSPV for classical functions (SRC). Suppose $f$ is a function described by a polynomial time classical Turing machine, which is public; the client would like to sample a random $x$ as the function input and use a protocol to send $f(x)$ to the server. What's more, (1) when the server is malicious, what it knows in the passing space should be no more than $f(x)$; (2) the communication should be succinct (that is, independent to the running time of evaluating $f$). Solving this problem in classical cryptography seems to require strong cryptographic assumptions.  We show that, perhaps surprisingly, it's possible to solve this problem with quantum techniques under much weaker assumptions. By allowing for quantum communication and computations, we give a protocol for this problem assuming only collapsing hash functions [Unr16]. Our work conveys an interesting message that quantum cryptography could outperform classical cryptography in a new type of problems, that is, to reduce communications in meaningful primitives without using heavy classical cryptographic assumptions.},

	abstract = {Achieving quantum computational advantage requires solving a classically intractable problem on a quantum device. Natural proposals rely upon the intrinsic hardness of classically simulating quantum mechanics; however, verifying the output is itself classically intractable. On the other hand, certain quantum algorithms (e.g. prime factorization via Shor's algorithm) are efficiently verifiable, but require more resources than what is available on near-term devices. One way to bridge the gap between verifiability and implementation is to use "interactions" between a prover and a verifier. By leveraging cryptographic functions, such protocols enable the classical verifier to enforce consistency in a quantum prover's responses across multiple rounds of interaction. In this work, we demonstrate the first implementation of an interactive quantum advantage protocol, using an ion trap quantum computer.  We execute two complementary protocols -- one based upon the learning with errors problem and another where the cryptographic construction implements a computational Bell test. To perform multiple rounds of interaction, we implement mid-circuit measurements on a subset of trapped ion qubits, with subsequent coherent evolution. For both protocols, the performance exceeds the asymptotic bound for classical behavior; maintaining this fidelity at scale would conclusively demonstrate verifiable quantum advantage.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate - the quantum reservoir - and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs, and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.},
